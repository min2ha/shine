<h2>About SHINE</h2>
<p>
This tool has been developed as part of the <a href="http://buddah.projects.history.ac.uk/">Big UK Data Arts and Humanities project</a> 
funded by the AHRC. Read more about the project on our <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/webarchive/2015/07/big-uk-domain-data-for-the-arts-and-humanities.html">blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
The data was acquired by JISC from the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> (IA) and 
includes all .uk websites in the IA web collection crawled between around 1996 until April 2013 
(<a href="http://data.webarchive.org.uk/opendata/ukwa.ds.2/#issues">you can read more details about this dataset here</a>). 
The collection comprises over 3.5 billion items (urls, images and other documents) and has been 
full-text indexed by the UK Web Archive. <i>Every word of every website in the collection can be 
searched for and analysed.</i>
</p>
	
<h2>What can I do?</h2>

<h3>Trend analysis</h3>
<p>
Use <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/graph">‘trends’</a> to analyse the number of pages a word or 
phrase appears in the collection over a given period (within 1996-2013). 
Comparisons can be drawn by adding several words or phrases separated by a comma. E.g. <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/graph?query=cat%2C+dog%2C+goldfish&year_start=1996&year_end=2013&action=update">cat, dog, goldfish</a>
</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="@routes.Assets.at("images/cat-dog-goldfish-sample.png")"/>
</p>
<p>
Clicking on a graph point gives a sample of websites that use that word or phrase and give the context it was used.
</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>
On the <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/search?facet.sort=index&tab=results">Search page</a>, you 
can enter search terms and get the results back as a list of pages, presenting more detailed information per page. 
The result set may be a VERY large number of webpages (possibly millions) and 
they are NOT ordered by relevance which you may expect with a search engine such as Google. 
</p>
<p class="text-center">
<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="@routes.Assets.at("images/shine-search.png")"/>
</p>
<p>
You can, however, narrow down the search with faceting on such things 
as ‘content type’, ‘year of capture’, domain and even Post Code amongst others.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="@routes.Application.searchTips">Search Tips</a> for help with search terms and query syntax.
